```

The master area occupies 40% of the available with and contains one view.

The left stack contains 3 views, the right stack the remainder.

The left and right stacks each occupy 30% of the available width.

5 may be moved into the master area with `riverctl send-layout-cmd wideriver "--count +1"`. 4 will be placed at the "top" of the stack, below 3.

### Monocle

`riverctl send-layout-cmd wideriver "--layout monocle"`

```

```

Only the currently focused view will be visible.

## LAYOUTS

The symbol is the layout name which may be shown in a status bar such as [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)'s [river/layout](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Module:-River#layout) module.

Dynamic settings are available via COMMANDS

*ratio* and *count* are persisted per tag and shared by all layouts except wide, which has its own values.

*stack* is persisted per tag and shared by all layouts.

When multiple tags are focused, the state is persisted for only the lowest tag.

### Left / Right

One master area occupying the full height of the available area with a stack area to the left or right.

*ratio* is the proportion of the available area occupied by master.

*count* is the number of evenly evenly stacked views in the master area.

Left: `│ ├─┤` when *count* > 0 otherwise `│├──┤`

Right: `├─┤ │` when *count* > 0 otherwise `├──┤│`

### Wide

One master area occupying the full height of the available area with a stack area to the left and the right.

*ratio* is the proportion of the available area occupied by master. Stacks occupy half of the remaining area.

*count* is the number of views in the left stack.

Master is centred when there are left and right stacks, otherwise it expands into the area that would be occupied the empty stacks.

`├─┤ ├─┤` when *count* > 0 otherwise `││  ├─┤`

### Monocle

Only one view is focused, occupying all of the available space.

`│ n │` with `n` showing number of views only when greater than 1.

## STACK ARRANGEMENTS

3 arrangements are available for the stack area. It is persisted per tag and applied to all layouts for that tag. See above for an example of each arrangement.

Stacks follow one or two directions determined by the layout.

### Even

This is the "traditional" arrangement with uniformly sized stack views.

Arranged in a column or row in the first stack direction only.

### Diminish

Arranged in a column or row in the first stack direction only.

Height or width diminishes according to the view’s position in the stack:

`2p / (n^2 + n)`

`n` number of views in the stack

`p` position in the stack

### Dwindle

Arranged in a dwindling manner alternating in both stack directions.

Each view occupies half the available / remaining area.

## GAPS

Gaps, in pixels, between windows may be injected. They are off by default.

`--inner-gaps` (`i`) are between windows.

`--outer-gaps` (`o`) are between the edge of the screen and windows.

`--smart-gaps` automatically hides the gaps when there is only one view or monocle layout.

```
